</p>

**Version:** 1.7.2

Welcome to **CCS Sleep Studio**, a high-performance, cross-platform desktop application designed to assist researchers and clinicians in sleep EEG visualization, event annotation, sleep scoring, automated staging, and advanced EEG analysis.

CCS Sleep Studio is comprised of the following key modules:
*   **ScoringNidra**: Interactive sleep scoring and event annotation module supporting EDF, Brain Products (.vhdr / .vmrk), Nihon Kohden (.EEG / .LOG), EMBLA (.ebm), Orbit (.orb), and R09 (.r09).
*   **AutoscoreNidra**: Automated sleep scoring module with both interactive and batch modes.
*   **AnalyseNidra**: Automated sleep EEG analysis and reporting module operating in both interactive and batch modes.

### 🌟 New in Version 1.7.0
*   **Universal Markers & Annotations Support**:
    *   Direct decoding of embedded **EDF+ TAL** (Time-stamped Annotation Lists).
    *   Native parsing of **Brain Products / BrainVision (`.vmrk`)** marker files.
    *   Parsing of **Nihon Kohden (`.LOG` / `.log`)** clinical event notes and timestamps.
    *   Support for **Compumedics Profusion / Alice XML (`.xml`)** scored event lists.
    *   Header-adaptive parsing of tabular **CSV / TSV / TXT** marker files (`${stem}_events.csv`).
    *   Crisp canvas rendering distinguishing point markers (vertical lines + top pill badge) and interval spans (shaded boxes + top pill badge).
    *   Interactive **Markers & Annotations Manager Dialog (`M`)** with category filter chips, search, click-to-jump navigation, and CSV export.
*   **Time-Synchronized Video Playback (`V`)**:
    *   Cross-platform video playback supporting MP4, MKV, AVI, MOV, and WebM on macOS and Windows.
    *   Automatic detection of companion video files in the recording directory.
    *   Bidirectional synchronization: epoch jumping immediately seeks the video, and playing video advances the EEG viewport.
    *   Floating control overlay with fine-grained sync offset adjustments (`-1s`, `-0.1s`, `+0.1s`, `+1s`, manual entry, and reset).
*   **Brain Products (`.vhdr` / `.vmrk`) Integration**:
    *   Native loading and channel scaling for Brain Products recordings in both interactive viewer and batch modes.
*   **Enhanced Navigation & Confidence Display**:
    *   Hypnogram overlay dropdown directly on the toolbar (SWA, P(Wake), P(N1), P(N2), P(N3), P(REM), Off).
    *   Context-aware "out-of" navigation readout (`/ 765`, `/ 06:22:30`, `/ 05:22:30`) matching Epoch, Elapsed, and Clock jump modes.
    *   Multi-stage probability display on the status bar showing confidence scores across all competing stages.

### 🌟 New in Version 1.6.0
*   **Nihon Kohden (.EEG) Support**: Native reading of multi-block Nihon Kohden recordings, active channel filtering (<70 channels), and complete extraction of multi-hour (>6h to 36h+) continuous PSG payload data.
*   **EMBLA (.ebm) Folder & File Loading**: Automatic multi-rate channel resampling (e.g. 10 Hz respiratory channels upsampled to match 200 Hz EEG) preserving full 7+ hour recording duration across 35+ channels.
*   **REMlogic & EMBLA Stage Scoring**: Direct native parsing of `.esedb` (OLE event store) and `.esrc` scoring files into 30-second epoch hypnograms and event annotations.

Built from the ground up using **Flutter** for a lightweight, fluid UI, and **Rust** for native-speed signal processing, **CCS Sleep Studio** is inspired heavily from the Python-based [ScoringHero](https://github.com/SvennoNito/ScoringHero) repository. It operates without any complex Python or MATLAB runtime setup, bringing near-instant response times to massive sleep EEG files and advanced analysis.

## About

**CCS Sleep Studio** is a standalone desktop platform for sleep EEG review, manual staging, automated sleep scoring, and quantitative sleep neurophysiology. It combines a Flutter interface with native Rust signal-processing backends so full-night polysomnography files can be loaded, filtered, scored, compared, and analyzed without maintaining a separate Python or MATLAB environment.

The application is built for research and clinical neurophysiology workflows that need repeatable staging, transparent manual review, batch processing, AnalyseNidra quantitative reports, and exportable outputs across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Sample PSG Data

The repository includes a small demonstration dataset in [`SamplePSGData`](SamplePSGData/) for testing the viewer, manual scoring import, batch workflows, and AnalyseNidra report generation.

* `SamplePSGData/Data/` contains four EDF PSG recordings.
* `SamplePSGData/ManualScorings/` contains matching manual scoring EDF files with the same base filenames.
* `SamplePSGData/Template_config.json` provides a reusable configuration template for the sample recordings.

Load a recording from `SamplePSGData/Data/`, then import the corresponding file from `SamplePSGData/ManualScorings/` as the scoring/comparison file.

## ⚡ Speed & Architectural Enhancements

CCS Sleep Studio overcomes the main performance bottlenecks of standard Python-based visualization tools:

1.  **Hybrid Flutter + Rust FFI Pipeline**: Heavy mathematical operations (zero-phase Chebyshev/Butterworth filters, Welch periodograms, Morlet wavelets) are written in Rust, leveraging SIMD compiler optimizations and multi-threaded processing via `rayon`.
2.  **Isolate-Based Background Worker**: Computations run off the main thread in background Dart **Isolates**, leaving the main interface to render at a locked 60+ FPS.
3.  **Zero-Copy Memory Access**: Transfers between Dart and Rust utilize direct pointers and `.asTypedList` buffer access to avoid slow copy loops.
    *   *Benchmarks*: Night-wide spectrogram updates complete in just **19 ms**, and wavelet time-frequency updates finish in **113 ms**.
4.  **Self-Contained Executables**: Zero environment configuration required. Even the Full edition bundles its model runtimes inside a standalone package.

## AutoscoreNidra — Automated Sleep Scoring (Full App Only)

**AutoscoreNidra** is the automated sleep-scoring system within CCS Sleep Studio. It provides a consistent UI, dependency preflight, live epoch progress, and local execution for modern deep-learning and machine-learning staging models:

*   **Multi-Montage Consensus Scoring**: AutoscoreNidra independently scores every selected EEG channel and clinically valid reference combination. It then combines their epoch-wise probabilities into one consensus hypnogram, reducing dependence on any single channel or montage.
*   **Optional SleepGPT Sequence Refinement**: After the base consensus scoring, SleepGPT can apply a condition-agnostic sequence correction pass. It uses the temporal sleep-stage sequence to reduce implausible transitions without requiring a diagnosis-specific model.
*   **Single-Channel EEG Support**: AutoscoreNidra can score recordings containing only one usable EEG channel. When multiple channels or reference combinations are available, it automatically expands to the multi-montage consensus workflow.
*   **Clear Scoring Filenames**: Final hypnograms use the suffix `_scoring.json`, for example `recording_yasa_scoring.json` or `recording_yasa_sleepgpt_scoring.json`, so they are easy to distinguish from AnalyseNidra and diagnostic JSON files.
*   **9 Supported Staging Models**:
    1.  **YASA LightGBM Consensus**: Lightweight boosted tree stager.
    2.  **Offline U-Sleep Consensus**: Local convolutional neural network inference.
    3.  **Luna POPS**: Probabilistic Sleep Stager (`lunapi` adapter).
    4.  **Greifswald Sleep Stage Classifier (GSSC)**: Clinical model stager.
    5.  **TinySleepNet**: Pretrained PhysioEx model.
    6.  **SeqSleepNet**: Sequence-to-sequence model.
    7.  **SleepTransformer**: Attention-based transformer stager.
    8.  **Dreamento**: Feature-engineered YASA classifier.
    9.  **SleepEEGpy**: Standard MNE/YASA scorer.
*   **Batch AutoscoreNidra**: Queue multiple EDF/ORB/SIGNAL files for sequential background scoring with live status and epoch progress.
*   **Interactive Checklists**: Configure stager EEG, EOG, EMG, and Reference signals dynamically using checklist selectors instead of manual comma-separated text input fields.

## AnalyseNidra — Advanced Sleep EEG Analysis

**AnalyseNidra** is the advanced quantitative neurophysiology subsystem, written in native Rust. It performs fast, multithreaded analysis of sleep architecture, spectral power, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC), slow waves, spindles, aperiodic dynamics, nonlinear complexity, and regional statistics.

By leveraging Rust's compiler optimizations and parallel execution (via `rayon`), the entire analysis runs over 6x faster than standard Python pipelines.

### Features
* **Spectral Analysis**: Fast Welch periodogram computation with median averaging.
* **Aperiodic Fit**: Native Levenberg-Marquardt implementations of FOOOF (Fitting Oscillations & One-Over-F) and IRASA (Irregularly Resampled Auto-Spectral Analysis) to isolate true oscillatory peaks from the background aperiodic 1/f slope.
* **Spindle Detection**: Port of the YASA (Yet Another Spindle Algorithm) spindle detection method.
* **Slow-Wave Detection**: Port of YASA slow-wave detection, including `sw_all_density_calc` normalized as slow-wave count per total NREM minute.
* **Phase-Amplitude Coupling (PAC)**: TensorPAC-compatible modulation index calculation for Slow-Wave/Sigma coupling.
* **Regional Compilation**: Aggregates all spectral features and event detections across scalp channels.
* **Master-Sheet Compilation**: Combines regional CSV outputs from the latest batch or independently completed AnalyseNidra runs into one provenance-preserving CSV.
* **Publication-Grade Sleep Report**: Generates a five-page PDF covering sleep continuity, thalamocortical coupling, FOOOF/IRASA aperiodic trends, oscillatory peaks, entropy, fractal dynamics, Lempel-Ziv complexity, autocorrelation windows, and a plain-English interpretation guide. Configurable study, investigator, and subject metadata can be added from the Report tab in Configuration.

### Command-Line Usage & Parameters
For advanced CLI workflows, the `analyse-nidra` executable can be invoked directly from the command line:

```sh

## 🎨 New UI Features

We have enriched the UI with several flexibility and control improvements:
*   **Smooth Draggable Plot Borders**: Manually adjust the vertical boundaries between the Spectrogram, Hypnogram, and Periodogram panels in real time by dragging. Resizing is cumulative, smooth, locked to respect screen size limits, and is automatically saved to the recording's `.config.json` file.
*   **Consolidated Batch Tab**: Houses Batch AutoscoreNidra, Batch AnalyseNidra, and AnalyseNidra master-sheet compilation in one workspace. Redundant batch menu commands are intentionally omitted.
*   **Hypnogram Horizontal Zoom**: View the hypnogram step chart fully (Full Night) or zoom in on 100, 200, or 400 epoch windows centered around the active epoch. All mouse taps map correctly to coordinates within the zoomed viewport.
*   **Wavelet Spectre Toggle**: The complex Morlet wavelet panel is off by default to avoid unnecessary computation and vertical scrolling, and can be enabled when needed.
*   **Slow Wave Activity (SWA) Toggle**: Show or hide the SWA delta-power overlay on the hypnogram timeline, hiding its slider controls when inactive.
*   **EEG Guide Customization**: Modify the thickness and color of the horizontal reference guide lines in the EEG viewport.
